Week1

We have a offline meeting and everyone is very friendly and nice. Firstly, we decided who to be the scrum master and oteher's role.
After that, we went to the proposal of this assignment and try to make everyone is happy with their work. But one of our team members
told me that he may drop this course since workload of other courses are too heavy, and he told us he decided to leave a day after, so
we rearranged our work and try to restart.


Week2
Since i am scrum master of this team, so i told my team members to remember upload their work diary on time, and my work is to complete 
user stories in Jira. At the beginning, it's not very easy for me to setup Jira and learn how to create user stories and epics in it. 
However, after struggling for a while, i understand how to use it and finally complete most of this work. Obviously, there are some erros 
that need to be recorrect such as grammar error or misunderstanding description of user storie, so I asked my team mates to help me find these
errors and fix them.Everyone is happy with user stories but i believe we should double check is there anything that need to be done to
achieve their needs. Therefore, I will lead my team members to review their work and try to make this proposal perfect at next week.
