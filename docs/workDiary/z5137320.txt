Week 1
Got meeting with team members and chose the exact project we want to create. We chose scrum master and spilt tasks.
I start learning spring boot , sql but still long way to go. 

Week 2

Discuss with Shizuka the story board. Start learning reactjs to build frontend. Still, long way to go.

Week3
Do recipe backend. Recipe can be added, deleted, eidted. Users can choose favorite recipes, can search for favorite reicpes.
System can recommend recipes which best match ingredients. 

Week 4
Recipe can search ingredients, pick ingredients, recommend recipes, filter recipes. 

Week 5
Add recipe with image and upload images for recipes. Check for constraints for ingredients. Work with Shizuka to debug recipe controller functions, fixed problems in search history.

Week 6
Add "/search" API in recipe controller, build a static class named "wrapper" in recipe controller. It is the option that explorer can choose which includes type and ingredient. Add a String converter in Search History class, which allow every list of string of ingredients to be store in database as a format of string. So evey time a user search a list of words, the data base can update its frequency. Also combine "/search" with searh for recipes and stores in search history table. Start with working on report, including how code implementates in backend.
