Week1

We have a offline meeting and everyone is very friendly and nice. Firstly, we decided who to be the scrum master and oteher's role.
After that, we went to the proposal of this assignment and try to make everyone is happy with their work. But one of our team members
told me that he may drop this course since workload of other courses are too heavy, and he told us he decided to leave a day after, so
we rearranged our work and try to restart.


Week2
Since i am scrum master of this team, so i told my team members to remember upload their work diary on time, and my work is to complete 
user stories in Jira. At the beginning, it's not very easy for me to setup Jira and learn how to create user stories and epics in it. 
However, after struggling for a while, i understand how to use it and finally complete most of this work. Obviously, there are some erros 
that need to be recorrect such as grammar error or misunderstanding description of user storie, so I asked my team mates to help me find these
errors and fix them.Everyone is happy with user stories but i believe we should double check is there anything that need to be done to
achieve their needs. Therefore, I will lead my team members to review their work and try to make this proposal perfect at next week. 

Week3
In order to ensure that the project can be tracked normally and communicated in time, we decided to hold an offline meeting every Sunday 
to summarize the problems and experiences that occurred during the week. At the same time, according to the plan, we started to do some 
tasks based on the user story, and the first thing that needs to be completed is account management, including login and logout and 
registration.However, due to limited familiarity with spring boot and css, some difficult bugs were encountered at the beginning, 
which caused some time wasted but was finally resolved. Next week will continue to do corresponding tasks according to the plan.

Week4

This week's tasks become more difficult than last week, because the tasks to be done are relatively tricky, and there are many functions 
that need to be implemented. At the same time, due to the different computer configuration and system of each team member, the connection 
between the front end and the back end is very difficult. Although we already know the corresponding content, it will still take some time 
for the website to run and successfully implement the function. At the same time, because each team member has a different grasp of spring boot, 
more time and communication are required to ensure the successful completion of the tasks.
