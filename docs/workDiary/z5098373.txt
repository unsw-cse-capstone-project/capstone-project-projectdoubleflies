Wokr Diary

Week 1 
We had a meeting in week 1, we got familiar with each other and selected our scrum master who is Kyrie, we decided to do meal match, after
that, we went through all the requirements of the proposal and he arrnaged what to do for ecah of us, my task is to write user stories 
and sprints.

Week 2
I read the description of meal match carefully, then i wrote the user stories and sent it to Kyrie, he uploaded it to jira and asked the 
other group member if there is any problem with the user stories, everyone was happy with that. We are going to have a meeting this week to
discuss further tasks. I hope everyone having a great time to do this project.
