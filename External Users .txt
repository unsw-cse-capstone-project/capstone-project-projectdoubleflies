External User: Meal Explorers and Meal Contributors. 
Interaction: 
1. All public users are explorers. They can view, pick and remove ingredients then submit a list of ingredients they want to explore. Then they can get visualized recipes filtered by our database based on the ingredients they have chosen. 
2. Public users can register if they do not have an account. After registration, users can be both an explorer and a contributor. They have their homepage, and the page shows their “favourite recipes”, their “uploaded recipes”. They can view, edit and delete the recipes. They can also upload new recipes. Once they enter ‘Upload Recipe Page”, they are free to input title, description, instruction, meal-type and choose ingredients with their category for the recipe. Once submitted, our system will insert the new recipe to the database and store corresponding recipe id to the contributor’s recipe id table.  
3. Meal explorers can add recipes posted on our website to their “favourite recipes”. Once done, our system will store the recipe to the explorers’ “favourite recipes” table in the database. Also, explorers can remove recipes in their favourite list if they lose interest.
